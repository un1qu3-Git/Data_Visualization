<h1>Data Visualization</h1>
Data visualization involves using visual representations to explore and understand data, often associated with data mining. Python, with tools like matplotlib and Pygal, enables efficient exploration of large data sets on a laptop. Visualizing data helps convey meaning and uncover patterns. Python is widely used in genetics, climate research, and more, offering a range of visualization and analysis tools. Matplotlib is a popular mathematical plotting library, and Pygal is suitable for creating interactive visualizations. The book covers creating simple plots and explores a random walk concept, as well as using Pygal to visualize dice rolling outcomes
